<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Rubber Anti Viscosity Agent Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Stearates</li><li>Fatty Acid Esters</li><li>Fatty Acid Amides</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Rubber anti-viscosity agents are substances used to reduce the viscosity or stickiness of rubber materials. Stearates, fatty acid esters, and fatty acid amides are three types of anti-viscosity agents commonly used in the rubber industry. Stearates are salts or esters of stearic acid that act as lubricants, improving the processability of rubber compounds. Fatty acid esters, derived from fatty acids and alcohols, also function as lubricants and flow modifiers. Fatty acid amides, on the other hand, act as slip agents, reducing friction between rubber surfaces.</p></p>
