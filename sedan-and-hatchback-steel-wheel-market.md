<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Sedan and Hatchback Steel Wheel Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Casting</li><li>Forging</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Sedan and Hatchback Steel Wheel market consists of two different types: Casting and Forging. Casting involves pouring molten steel into a mold and allowing it to solidify into the desired shape. This method is cost-effective and allows for complex designs. On the other hand, Forging involves shaping the steel through the application of heat and pressure. This process creates a stronger and more durable wheel, but it is more expensive than casting. Both methods have their own advantages and are used in the production of steel wheels for Sedans and Hatchbacks.</p></p>
