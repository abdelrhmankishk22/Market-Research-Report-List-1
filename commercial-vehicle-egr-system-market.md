<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Commercial Vehicle EGR System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Electric EGR Valve</li><li>Pneumatic EGR Valve</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Commercial Vehicle EGR System Market consists of two main types of EGR valves: Electric EGR Valve and Pneumatic EGR Valve. Electric EGR valves are electronically controlled and regulate exhaust gas recirculation in commercial vehicles. They are known for their precise control, durability, and ability to monitor and adjust EGR rates according to engine conditions. On the other hand, Pneumatic EGR valves use compressed air to regulate exhaust gas recirculation. They are simpler in design and operation, but may not offer the same level of control and precision as electric valves.</p></p>
