<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Continuous Heating Furnace Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Rotary-Hearth Type</li><li>Straight-Chamber Type</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Continuous Heating Furnace market comprises two major types: Rotary-Hearth Type and Straight-Chamber Type. The Rotary-Hearth Type furnace consists of a rotating hearth where the material being heated moves in circular motion, allowing for uniform heating. On the other hand, the Straight-Chamber Type furnace features a stationary chamber where the material remains in a fixed position while being heated. Both types offer efficient and continuous heating solutions for industrial purposes. However, they differ in terms of the movement of the material during the heating process.</p></p>
