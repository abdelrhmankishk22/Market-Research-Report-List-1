<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The I-line Photoresist Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Photopolymerization</li><li>Light Decomposition Type</li><li>Photocrosslinked</li></ul></p>
<p><p>I-line photoresist refers to a type of photolithography material used in semiconductor manufacturing. There are three main types within the I-line photoresist market: photopolymerization, light decomposition, and photocrosslinked. Photopolymerization involves the use of UV light to initiate a chemical reaction that results in the hardening of the photoresist. Light decomposition type employs a photosensitive molecule that splits upon exposure to light, creating a solid film. Photocrosslinked photoresists, on the other hand, rely on the crosslinking of polymer chains under UV light to form a durable pattern. These different types offer various advantages and applications within the semiconductor industry.</p></p>
