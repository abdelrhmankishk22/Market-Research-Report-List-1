<p><p>Flue Gas Desulphurization (FGD) Gypsum is a byproduct of the flue gas desulphurization process, which is used to remove sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions from fossil fuel power plants. This process involves scrubbing the flue gases with a limestone slurry, resulting in the formation of FGD gypsum. It is primarily composed of calcium sulfate dihydrate (CaSO4·2H2O).</p><p>The FGD gypsum market is experiencing significant growth due to the increasing demand for sulfur pollution control systems in power plants and other industrial applications. The stringent environmental regulations regarding SO2 emissions, along with the rising awareness about pollution control, are driving the adoption of FGD gypsum. Additionally, the growing need for sustainable waste management practices is further propelling the market growth.</p><p>In terms of market analysis, the FGD gypsum market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 9.4% during the forecast period. Growth in the construction industry, particularly in developing countries, is one of the key factors driving the demand for FGD gypsum. The construction sector utilizes FGD gypsum in various applications, including wallboard, plaster, cement additives, and soil amendment, due to its beneficial properties such as fire resistance and ease of handling.</p><p>Furthermore, the latest trend in the FGD gypsum market is the increasing focus on the development of synthetic gypsum, which is generated from various industrial processes such as phosphoric acid production or citric acid production. Synthetic gypsum offers similar properties as FGD gypsum and can be used as a substitute, reducing the dependence on FGD gypsum from power plants.</p><p>In conclusion, the Flue Gas Desulphurization (FGD) Gypsum Market is witnessing significant growth due to the rising demand for sulfur pollution control systems and the need for sustainable waste management practices. The market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 9.4% during the forecast period. Additionally, the development of synthetic gypsum is emerging as a key trend in the market.</p></p>
