<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Vehicle Hydraulic Retarder Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Water Medium Retarder</li><li>Oil Medium Retarder</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Vehicle Hydraulic Retarder Market includes two main types: Water Medium Retarder and Oil Medium Retarder. Water Medium Retarder refers to a hydraulic retarder system that uses water as the medium for retarding the vehicle. This system operates by transferring kinetic energy into thermal energy through the interaction between brake discs and the water. On the other hand, Oil Medium Retarder uses oil as the medium for retarding the vehicle. Similar to the water medium, the oil medium system converts kinetic energy into thermal energy, providing effective braking and slowing down the vehicle.</p></p>
