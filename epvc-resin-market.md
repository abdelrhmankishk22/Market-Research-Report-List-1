<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The EPVC Resin Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Homopolymeric EPVC</li><li>Co-polymeric EPVC</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>EPVC resin is a type of polymer used in various applications such as construction, automotive, and electrical industries. It can be classified into two main types: homopolymeric EPVC and co-polymeric EPVC. Homopolymeric EPVC is made up of a single type of vinyl chloride monomer, resulting in a relatively rigid and high-performance resin. On the other hand, co-polymeric EPVC is created by combining vinyl chloride monomers with other monomers, offering improved flexibility and impact resistance. Both types have their unique properties and are utilized based on specific requirements in different industries.</p></p>
