<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Investment Casting Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Sodium Silicate Process</li><li>Tetraethyl Orthosilicate (Silica Sol Process)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Investment casting market types can be classified into two main processes: Sodium Silicate Process and Tetraethyl Orthosilicate (Silica Sol Process). In the Sodium Silicate Process, a water glass binder is mixed with refractory materials such as zircon sand or fused silica, and then coated onto the wax pattern. After drying, the mold is heated to remove the wax. In the Tetraethyl Orthosilicate (Silica Sol Process), a colloidal suspension of silica particles is used as the binder. This process offers better surface finish and dimensional accuracy compared to the Sodium Silicate Process.</p></p>
