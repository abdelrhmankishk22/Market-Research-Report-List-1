<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Distillers Corn Oil Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dry-Milling</li><li>Wet-Milling</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Distillers corn oil is produced as a byproduct of corn ethanol production. There are two main types of distillers corn oil markets: dry-milling and wet-milling. In the dry-milling process, corn is ground into flour and then processed to produce ethanol and distillers grains, from which corn oil is extracted. Wet-milling, on the other hand, involves steeping corn in water to separate it into germ, starch, and gluten. The germ is then used to produce corn oil. Both types of markets contribute to the production and distribution of distillers corn oil.</p></p>
