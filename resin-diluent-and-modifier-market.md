<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Resin Diluent and Modifier Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-reactive Type</li><li>Reactive Type</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The resin diluent and modifier market consists of two main types: non-reactive type and reactive type. Non-reactive type refers to substances that do not chemically react with the resin but rather dissolve or disperse within it, altering its properties. Non-reactive diluents are typically used to improve flow, increase flexibility, or reduce viscosity. On the other hand, reactive type involves diluents that chemically react with the resin, undergoing a chemical reaction to form a new compound. This type is used to modify the resin's properties, such as enhancing adhesion, reducing curing time, or improving toughness.</p></p>
