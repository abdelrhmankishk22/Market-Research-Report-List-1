<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Defibrillators for Public Access Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Semi-automated</li><li>Fully automated</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Defibrillators for public access come in two market types: semi-automated and fully automated. Semi-automated defibrillators require the user to interpret the heart rhythm and push a shock button if necessary, while fully automated defibrillators analyze the heart rhythm and deliver a shock without user intervention. Both types are designed for non-medical personnel and are widely used in public spaces, such as airports and schools, to provide immediate assistance in case of cardiac emergencies, increasing the chances of survival until professional medical help arrives.</p></p>
