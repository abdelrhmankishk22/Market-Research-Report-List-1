<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Wet Granulator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>High-shear</li><li>Low-shear</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Wet granulator market can be categorized into two types: high-shear and low-shear. High-shear granulators are designed to generate intense mechanical forces, efficiently breaking down materials into smaller particles. They are preferred for applications requiring fine granulation. On the other hand, low-shear granulators operate at gentler forces, suitable for materials that are easily deformable or sensitive to heat. They are commonly used for processes that require controlled granule size and maintain the integrity of the product. Both types serve different granulation needs in various industries.</p></p>
