<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Carbon Matrix Composites Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Impregnation method</li><li>CVD method</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Carbon matrix composites are materials consisting of carbon fibers embedded in a carbon matrix. Impregnation method refers to the process where the carbon fibers are immersed in a liquid resin, allowing it to penetrate the fiber structure before solidifying. This method offers good control over fiber volume fraction and orientation. On the other hand, the CVD method involves depositing carbon-rich gases onto a substrate, forming a layer of carbon and gradually building up the composite. This method provides excellent control over the carbon structure and can produce complex shapes.</p></p>
