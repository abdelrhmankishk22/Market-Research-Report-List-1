<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Photovoltaic Tracking Bracket Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Two-row Component Tracking</li><li>Single-row Component Tracking</li></ul></p>
<p><p>There are two main types of Photovoltaic Tracking Brackets: Two-row Component Tracking and Single-row Component Tracking. Two-row Component Tracking involves installing two rows of solar panels horizontally, which allows for efficient sunlight capture throughout the day. On the other hand, Single-row Component Tracking involves installing only one row of solar panels, which may be more suitable for smaller spaces or lower sunlight availability. Both types aim to optimize solar panel performance by adjusting their angles to track the movement of the sun and maximize energy generation.</p></p>
