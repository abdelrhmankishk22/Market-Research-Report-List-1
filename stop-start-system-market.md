<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Stop-Start-System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Automatically</li><li>Non-Automatic</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The stop-start system market can be divided into two types: automatic and non-automatic. In automatic systems, the engine automatically shuts off when the vehicle comes to a stop and restarts when the driver releases the brake pedal. This helps reduce fuel consumption and emissions, as well as engine wear. Non-automatic systems require the driver to manually engage and disengage the system, usually by pressing a button, when stopping and starting the vehicle. Both types aim to improve fuel efficiency and reduce environmental impact, but automatic systems provide a more convenient and seamless experience for the driver.</p></p>
