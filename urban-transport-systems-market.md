<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Urban Transport Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Semi-rapid Transport Systems</li><li>Rapid Transport Systems</li></ul></p>
<p><p>In the urban transport systems market, there are two main types: semi-rapid transport systems and rapid transport systems. Semi-rapid transport systems are designed to provide faster travel within urban areas, usually through elevated or underground railways that connect various destinations. They offer a higher speed than traditional transport modes but are not as fast as rapid transport systems. Rapid transport systems, on the other hand, are specifically designed for fast and efficient transportation, with features like dedicated tracks or lanes and high-speed trains or buses. These systems aim to provide quick and reliable commuting options for urban dwellers.</p></p>
