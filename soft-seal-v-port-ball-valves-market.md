<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Soft Seal V Port Ball Valves Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Flangedless</li><li>Flanged</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Soft Seal V Port Ball Valves are available in two market types: Flangedless and Flanged. Flangedless valves do not have flanges attached, which means they need to be welded directly onto the piping system. On the other hand, Flanged valves come with flanges that enable easy installation and connection to the pipeline using bolted joints. Both types of valves serve the purpose of controlling the flow of fluids or gases, with Flanged valves offering more convenience in terms of installation and maintenance due to their flange connection feature.</p></p>
