<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Chiral Separation Chromatography Columns Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Empty Columns</li><li>Pre-packed Columns</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Chiral separation chromatography columns are used to separate chiral compounds, which have mirror-image isomers, into their individual forms. Empty columns refer to columns that are bought empty and need to be packed with the chiral stationary phase by the user themselves. Pre-packed columns, on the other hand, come already filled with the chiral stationary phase, eliminating the need for manual packing. Both types of columns offer solutions for chiral separation, but the main difference lies in the preparation method, with pre-packed columns offering convenience and time-saving advantages.</p></p>
