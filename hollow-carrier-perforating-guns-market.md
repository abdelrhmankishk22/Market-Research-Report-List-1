<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hollow-carrier Perforating Guns Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>WCP Type</li><li>TCP Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Hollow-carrier perforating guns are used in the oil and gas industry for well stimulation. There are two main types of perforating guns in the market: WCP (Wireline Conveyed Perforating) and TCP (Tubing Conveyed Perforating). WCP guns are conveyed into the wellbore using a wireline cable, while TCP guns are conveyed through the production tubing. WCP guns offer faster and more cost-effective operations, while TCP guns are preferred in situations where wellbore conditions are challenging or when well control is a concern. Both types serve the purpose of creating perforations in the well casing to allow for oil or gas flow.</p></p>
