<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Road Marking Materials Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Performance-Based Markings</li><li>Paint-Based Markings</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Road marking materials are used to create clear and durable markings on roads and highways for better visibility and safety. There are two main types of road marking materials: performance-based markings and paint-based markings. Performance-based markings use thermoplastic materials that can withstand heavy traffic and harsh weather conditions, ensuring long-lasting and high-performance markings. On the other hand, paint-based markings use solvent-based or water-based paints that are more cost-effective but less durable, requiring regular maintenance and repainting.</p></p>
