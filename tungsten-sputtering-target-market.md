<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Tungsten Sputtering Target Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Rotary Type</li><li>Non Rotatable Type</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The tungsten sputtering target market can be classified into two main types: rotary type and non-rotatable type. In the rotary type market, the sputtering target is attached to a rotating mechanism that ensures a uniform erosion and deposition on the substrate. On the other hand, the non-rotatable type market involves stationary sputtering targets that do not rotate during the sputtering process. Both types have their own advantages and applications depending on the desired coating thickness, target material utilization, and specific requirements of the semiconductor and electronics industries.</p></p>
