<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Diamond Coated Cutting Tools Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>CVD Diamond-coated</li><li>PVD Diamond-coated</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Diamond-coated cutting tools market consists of two types of coatings: CVD (Chemical Vapor Deposition) diamond-coated and PVD (Physical Vapor Deposition) diamond-coated. CVD coating involves the deposition of diamond particles onto the tool's surface through a chemical reaction, resulting in a highly durable and wear-resistant layer. In contrast, PVD coating entails the vaporization of diamond particles and their subsequent deposition onto the tool's surface, creating a thin yet hard and smooth coating. Both coatings enhance the cutting tools' performance by improving hardness, heat resistance, and reducing friction, leading to increased productivity and longer tool lifespan.</p></p>
