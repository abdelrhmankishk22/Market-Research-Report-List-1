<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Damping Bridge Bearing Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Fixed Type</li><li>Guided Type</li><li>Free Sliding Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The damping bridge bearing market can be classified into three types: fixed type, guided type, and free sliding type. The fixed type bearing is suited for bridges with limited movements as it restricts both horizontal and vertical movement. The guided type allows horizontal movement while restricting vertical movement, making it suitable for bridges with expansion joints. The free sliding type enables both horizontal and vertical movement, making it ideal for long-span bridges that experience significant expansion and contraction.</p></p>
