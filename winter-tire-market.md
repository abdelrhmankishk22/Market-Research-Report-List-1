<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Winter Tire Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Studded</li><li>Studless</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The winter tire market consists of two main types: studded and studless. Studded tires are equipped with metal studs that protrude from the tread to enhance traction on icy surfaces. These studs dig into the ice, providing better grip and increased safety. On the other hand, studless tires rely on advanced rubber compounds and innovative tread patterns for traction on snow and ice. They do not have metal studs, making them a quieter and more comfortable option for winter driving. Overall, both types cater to different preferences and weather conditions.</p></p>
