<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Advanced Suspension System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Independent Automotive Suspension System</li><li>Non-independent Automotive Suspension System</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The automotive advanced suspension system market consists of two main types: independent and non-independent suspension systems. Independent suspension systems allow each wheel to move independently, resulting in better handling, comfort, and stability on uneven terrains. These systems are commonly found in high-performance and luxury vehicles. On the other hand, non-independent suspension systems use a solid axle to connect both wheels on one axle, leading to reduced comfort and handling but are more cost-effective and suitable for heavy-duty vehicles and off-road applications.</p></p>
