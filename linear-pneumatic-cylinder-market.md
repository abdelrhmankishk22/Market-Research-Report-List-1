<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Linear Pneumatic Cylinder Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Double Acting</li><li>Single Acting</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The linear pneumatic cylinder market is divided into two main types: double-acting and single-acting cylinders. Double-acting cylinders are capable of generating motion in both directions, with compressed air being used to extend and retract the piston. They offer precise control and are commonly used in industrial applications where accurate and consistent movement is required. On the other hand, single-acting cylinders generate motion in one direction only, typically using compressed air to extend the piston while relying on external forces, such as springs, to retract it. They are commonly used in simpler applications where the return force is not critical.</p></p>
