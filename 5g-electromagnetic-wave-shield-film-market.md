<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The 5G Electromagnetic Wave Shield Film Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Metal-mesh Film</li><li>Coating Film</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The 5G electromagnetic wave shield film market encompasses two main types: metal-mesh film and coating film. Metal-mesh films consist of a thin layer of metal wires that are weaved or etched onto a transparent substrate. They provide high shielding effectiveness against electromagnetic waves while maintaining transparency. On the other hand, coating films are made of conductive materials coated onto a transparent film. They offer similar shielding properties but are more flexible and easier to apply. Both types of films aim to protect electronic devices from potential electromagnetic interference caused by the increased use of 5G technology.</p></p>
