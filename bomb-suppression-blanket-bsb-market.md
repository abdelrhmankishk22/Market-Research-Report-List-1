<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bomb Suppression Blanket (BSB) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Threat Level 1: Fragment Velocity 400 M/Sec V50 Standard</li><li>Threat Level 2: Fragment Velocity 500 M/Sec V50 Standard</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Bomb Suppression Blanket (BSB) market consists of two main types based on the threat level they can withstand. Threat Level 1 BSBs are designed to handle fragment velocities up to 400 meters per second (m/sec) following the V50 standard. This means that they can effectively suppress the impact of explosive fragments traveling at this velocity. On the other hand, Threat Level 2 BSBs are built to withstand higher fragment velocities of up to 500 m/sec according to the V50 standard, providing increased protection against more powerful explosions.</p></p>
