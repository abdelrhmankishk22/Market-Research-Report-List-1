<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Offshore Gangways Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Fixed</li><li>Telescopic</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The offshore gangways market consists of two main types: fixed and telescopic gangways. Fixed gangways are designed to provide a permanent and stable access point between a vessel and a structure, like an offshore platform. They offer a secure and reliable transfer for personnel and equipment. On the other hand, telescopic gangways are adjustable in length and provide flexibility in accessing different heights or positions. They are commonly used in situations where the distance between the vessel and the structure may change frequently. Both types of gangways play a crucial role in offshore operations, ensuring safe and efficient transfers.</p></p>
