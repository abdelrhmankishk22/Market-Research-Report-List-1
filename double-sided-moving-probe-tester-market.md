<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Double-sided Moving Probe Tester Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Semi-Automatic Tester</li><li>Fully-Automatic Tester</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The double-sided moving probe tester market consists of two main types: semi-automatic testers and fully automatic testers. A semi-automatic tester requires some level of human intervention during the testing process. It may involve manual loading and unloading of circuit boards or some manual adjustments. On the other hand, a fully automatic tester does not require human intervention as it can perform all testing processes automatically, including loading and unloading circuit boards and making necessary adjustments. Both types cater to the need for testing circuit boards, but with varying levels of automation.</p></p>
