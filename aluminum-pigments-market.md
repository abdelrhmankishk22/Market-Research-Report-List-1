<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Aluminum Pigments Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Floating Aluminum Pigment</li><li>Non-floating Aluminum Pigment</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The aluminum pigments market can be divided into two types: floating aluminum pigment and non-floating aluminum pigment. Floating aluminum pigment refers to particles that are lighter and can remain suspended in liquids or paints. They provide a metallic shine to coatings, inks, and plastics. On the other hand, non-floating aluminum pigments are denser and tend to settle at the bottom, requiring constant stirring or agitation. These pigments are used in applications where a heavier metallic effect is desired, such as automotive coatings and decorative paints.</p></p>
